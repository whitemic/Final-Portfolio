# Final-Portfolio

This portfolio site was inspired by one highlighted on the Materialize css library website but has been adapted to fit my own personal style. Included is a home page with links to my projects page and about me page. There is also a side navigation with links to the various pages of my site as well as my social links. 

I used both bootstrap and media queries in order to make the site responsive and I am going through testing on various devices to see where I can tweak that responsiveness in future updates.
